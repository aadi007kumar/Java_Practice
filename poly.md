# What is Polymorphism?
Literally "many forms," it's the ability of an object to take on many shapes. In Java, this means a parent class reference can hold a child class object, allowing us to write flexible and reusable code.
Think of a remote control's Power button. The button is the same, but it behaves differently for a TV, a Sound System, or a Blu-ray player.
Polymorphism in Java comes in two main flavors:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Binding)
Achieved via Method Overloading.
What it is: Multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters.
How it works: The compiler knows exactly which method to call at compile time based on the arguments you provide.
Example: calculator.add(2, 3) vs. calculator.add(2, 3, 4)
2Ô∏è‚É£ Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding)
Achieved via Method Overriding.
What it is: A subclass provides its own specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.
How it works: The decision of which method to call is delayed until runtime. This is where the real power lies, and it's made possible by...

# The Magic Behind It All: Dynamic Method Dispatch ‚ú®
This is the mechanism that makes Runtime Polymorphism work. It's how the JVM decides which overridden method to execute at runtime.
Here‚Äôs the process:
A superclass reference is used to point to a subclass object.
Animal myPet = new Dog();
At Compile Time: The compiler only checks the reference type (Animal) to see if the method (makeSound()) exists there. If it does, the code compiles.
At Runtime: The JVM looks at the actual object (Dog) that the reference is holding and calls the method from that object.
üí° The Golden Rule: The method that gets called is determined by the Object's Type at Runtime, not the Reference's Type at Compile Time.
